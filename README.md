# MEV Resist Aggregator: A Revolutionary FHE-Based DEX Aggregator

The MEV Resist Aggregator is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to provide a secure trading experience. Our primary goal is to optimize not just for the best prices, but also to protect users from malicious front-running and Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. By incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques, we offer users peace of mind, allowing them to engage in trading without the fear of exploitation.

## The Problem: Navigating MEV Threats

In the fast-paced world of DeFi, traders often find themselves vulnerable to MEV attacks, where opportunistic actors exploit transaction ordering for profit at the expense of ordinary users. This vulnerability not only undermines user trust but also discourages participation in decentralized finance platforms. Our solution addresses these critical concerns by offering a DEX aggregator that prioritizes user security while optimizing trade execution.

## The FHE Solution: Encrypted Trading for Maximum Security

At the heart of the MEV Resist Aggregator is **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption**. This powerful technology allows us to process encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first, ensuring that sensitive transaction details remain confidential throughout the trading process. By utilizing Zama's open-source libraries, including the **Concrete** SDK and **TFHE-rs**, we implement robust trade routing strategies that mitigate the risk of MEV attacks. Users can place trades securely, knowing that their information is protected and that their transactions are executed fairly.

## Core Features of MEV Resist Aggregator

- **FHE-Encrypted Trade Routing:** All trade routing and execution strategies are encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption, preventing MEV exploitation.
- **MEV Resistance Optimization:** The platform focuses on optimizing trade execution not only for price but also to avoid MEV, providing a safer trading environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our aggregator offers a simple, intuitive interface that allows users to trade seamlessly without needing deep technical knowledge.
- **Automated Risk Assessment:** The application features built-in MEV risk assessments to inform users of potential vulnerabilities during trade execution.

## Technology Stack

The MEV Resist Aggregator is built upon a robust technology stack, ensuring security, reliability, and performance:

- **Zama's Concrete SDK:** For implementing fully homomorphic encryption in trade routing and execution.
- **TFHE-rs:** A Rust library for fast and efficient FHE operations.
- **Node.js:** For backend services and server-side logic.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** For smart contract development and deployment.
- **Web3.js:** For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

```

## Installation Guide

To set up the MEV Resist Aggregator locally, ensure you have installed **Node.js** and either **Hardhat** or **Foundry**. Follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries.
3. Ensure you have the necessary access to the Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet) for deployment.

**Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs to initiate the project setup.**

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the MEV Resist Aggregator, use the following commands:

1. To compile the smart contracts, execute:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. To run tests and ensure all functionalities are working correctly, use:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Finally, to deploy the contracts to the desired Ethereum network, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

### Example Usage

Here’s a small code snippet demonstrating how users can interact with the MEV Resist Aggregator:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://your.ethereum.node');

async function executeTrade(tradeData) {
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(aggregatorABI, aggregatorAddress);
    const tx = await contract.methods.executeTrade(tradeData).send({ from: userAddress });
    console.log(`Trade executed: ${tx.transactionHash}`);
}

// Example trade data
const tradeData = {
    tokenIn: '0xTokenAddress',
    tokenOut: '0xTokenAddress',
    amountIn: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'),
};

executeTrade(tradeData);
```
